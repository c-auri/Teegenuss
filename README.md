# Project Teegenuss
This is my personal website that I use to share imported tea samples from overseas. It is hosted at [Projekt-Teegenuss.de](Projekt-Teegenuss.de).

I designed and implemented the site at the start of 2022, when I was still a beginner at front end development. I learned a lot since then and would do many things differently. I also used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as a static site generator, which proved to be quite a limiting factor and resulted in some less than optimal workarounds.

Therefore, I am currently in the process of rewriting the site using [Astro](https://astro.build/), [React](https://react.dev/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). Some of the designs for the new site can be found on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/xlKHxIlpcfKAn9xnIMiv0c/Teegenuss-(Copy)?node-id=32-4). The current state of development can be found in the `astro` branch and is hosted at [netlify](https://teegenuss.netlify.app/).
